# Legal & Ethical Use

## What TweetYoink Does

TweetYoink is a **personal research tool** that extracts publicly visible tweet data from your browser's DOM. It works similarly to taking screenshots or using copy/paste - but provides structured data instead.

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Only captures publicly visible data (what you can already see)
- ✅ Requires explicit user action (clicking "Yoink" button)
- ✅ One tweet at a time (not automated/bulk scraping)
- ✅ Data sent to YOUR configured backend (you control everything)
- ✅ Does not use Twitter's API (no API terms violated)
- ✅ Does not bypass authentication or paywalls

## Intended Use Cases

**Legitimate Uses:**
- 📊 Personal research and data analysis
- 🤖 Creating LLM training datasets for educational purposes
- 📚 Content archival and documentation
- 🔍 Fact-checking and verification workflows
- 📝 Academic research and citation management

**NOT Intended For:**
- ❌ Violating Twitter/X Terms of Service
- ❌ Unauthorized commercial data scraping
- ❌ Mass automated data collection
