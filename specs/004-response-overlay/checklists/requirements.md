# Specification Quality Checklist: Server Response Overlay Display

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass âœ…

All checklist items pass validation:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-focused language, avoids implementation details, and focuses on what users need to accomplish.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 12 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - Success criteria include specific metrics (200ms response time, 95% success rate, 320px-3840px viewport support)
   - 3 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P3) and acceptance scenarios
   - 6 edge cases identified for consideration
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed - reasonable defaults assumed

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Core MVP (P1) can be independently tested and delivers immediate value
   - Extension capabilities (P2, P3) build incrementally on core
   - All requirements trace back to user scenarios
   - Success criteria are measurable without knowledge of implementation

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications required - feature is well-defined within the context of existing TweetYoink functionality
- Assumed standard web overlay patterns (close on ESC, click outside, close button) as industry best practices
