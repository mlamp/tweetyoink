# Specification Quality Checklist: Initial Project Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED âœ…

All validation criteria have been met. The specification is complete and ready for the planning phase.

### Details:

**Content Quality**: All checks passed
- The spec focuses on developer experience and user value (ability to load and develop the extension)
- No specific implementation details included (frameworks mentioned only in assumptions section, not requirements)
- Written in clear, non-technical language for user scenarios
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All checks passed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in the specification
- All 12 functional requirements are testable (e.g., "Extension MUST be loadable in Chrome" can be verified by loading it)
- All 8 success criteria are measurable (specific time targets, error counts, etc.)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "Developer can load extension in under 1 minute" vs "Vite builds in under 10 seconds")
- 5 acceptance scenarios per user story, all with Given/When/Then structure
- 5 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Scope clearly bounded to initial setup only (no tweet capture functionality)
- 6 assumptions documented

**Feature Readiness**: All checks passed
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 3 user stories cover the complete developer workflow (load, build/reload, debug)
- All success criteria are measurable and verifiable
- No implementation leaks (TypeScript, Vite only mentioned in assumptions, not requirements)

## Notes

The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` commands.

Key strengths:
- Very clear scope (initial setup only)
- Excellent testability (all requirements can be verified)
- Good prioritization (P0 for loading, P1 for iteration)
- Comprehensive edge cases
- Clear assumptions documented
