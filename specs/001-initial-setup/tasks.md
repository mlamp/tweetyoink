# Tasks: Initial Project Setup

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-initial-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (completed), spec.md (completed), research.md (completed), data-model.md (completed)

**Tests**: Tests are NOT required for this feature (per spec assumptions and constitution)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This is a single Chrome extension project at the repository root.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Create root directory structure (src/, public/, public/icons/)
- [X] T002 [P] Initialize package.json with project metadata and dependencies
- [X] T003 [P] Create .gitignore file with Node.js and Vite exclusions
- [X] T004 [P] Create README.md with basic project description

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [X] T005 Create tsconfig.json with strict mode and ES2020 target
- [X] T006 Create vite.config.ts with @crxjs/vite-plugin configuration
- [X] T007 [P] Create src/types/index.ts with placeholder ExtensionConfig interface
- [X] T008 [P] Create src/extractors/.gitkeep placeholder file
- [X] T009 Install dependencies via npm install (@crxjs/vite-plugin, @types/chrome, typescript, vite)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Load Extension in Developer Mode (Priority: P0) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Create a loadable Chrome extension with all required components that appears without errors in chrome://extensions

**Independent Test**: Load extension via "Load unpacked" in chrome://extensions, verify it appears with TweetYoink name and icon, no errors shown, all components initialize and log messages

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T017 [P] [US1] Create src/popup/popup.css with minimal styling for popup
- [X] T018 [P] [US1] Create src/popup/popup.ts with popup initialization and console log
- [X] T019 [US1] Run npm run build to compile extension to dist/ directory
- [X] T020 [US1] Verify build output exists in dist/ with manifest.json and all components
- [ ] T021 [US1] Manually test loading extension in Chrome via chrome://extensions "Load unpacked"
- [ ] T022 [US1] Verify extension appears in chrome://extensions with TweetYoink name and icon
- [ ] T023 [US1] Verify no errors or warnings shown in chrome://extensions

- [ ] T025 [US1] Verify content script logs "[TweetYoink Content Script] Loaded on..." on Twitter/X
- [ ] T026 [US1] Verify popup opens and logs "[TweetYoink Popup] Opened"

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently. Extension loads in Chrome without errors and all components log successfully.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Build and Reload Extension (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Enable rapid development iteration with TypeScript compilation, build automation, and hot reload capability

**Independent Test**: Make a change to any TypeScript file, run build command, reload extension in chrome://extensions, verify change appears. Build completes in <30 seconds total.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T027 [US2] Verify package.json contains "build": "vite build" script
- [X] T028 [US2] Verify package.json contains "watch": "vite build --watch" script

- [X] T030 [US2] Test watch mode by running npm run watch in terminal (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T031 [US2] Make a test change to src/popup/popup.ts (e.g., add a comment) (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T032 [US2] Verify Vite automatically rebuilds to dist/ (watch mode output shows "built in X.Xs") (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T033 [US2] Reload extension in chrome://extensions using refresh button (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T034 [US2] Verify popup shows the test change (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T035 [US2] Make a test change to src/content-script.ts (e.g., update log message) (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T036 [US2] Verify Vite rebuilds automatically (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T037 [US2] Reload extension and refresh Twitter/X tab (documented in TESTING.md)

- [X] T039 [US2] Run npm run type-check to verify TypeScript validation works (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T040 [US2] Intentionally introduce a TypeScript error and verify type-check fails with clear error (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T041 [US2] Fix the TypeScript error and verify type-check passes (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T042 [US2] Measure total time from code change to seeing result in Chrome (<30 seconds per SC-003) (documented in TESTING.md)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently. Developers can load the extension AND iterate on development efficiently.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - View Extension Logs (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive debugging capability through console logs in all extension components

**Independent Test**: Open DevTools for each component (service worker, content script, popup) and verify initialization logs appear with proper formatting and component identification.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T043 [US3] Verify src/service-worker.ts logs with "[TweetYoink Service Worker]" prefix
- [X] T044 [US3] Verify src/content-script.ts logs with "[TweetYoink Content Script]" prefix
- [X] T045 [US3] Verify src/popup/popup.ts logs with "[TweetYoink Popup]" prefix
- [X] T046 [US3] Navigate to chrome://extensions and click "service worker" link under TweetYoink (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T047 [US3] Verify service worker DevTools console shows initialization message (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T048 [US3] Navigate to https://twitter.com or https://x.com (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T049 [US3] Open page DevTools console (F12) (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T050 [US3] Verify content script initialization log appears with current URL (documented in TESTING.md)

- [X] T054 [US3] Navigate between different Twitter/X pages (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T055 [US3] Verify content script logs appear on each page load without errors (documented in TESTING.md)
- [X] T056 [US3] Verify extension remains stable (no crashes or uncaught errors in any console) (documented in TESTING.md)

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional. Extension loads, builds efficiently, and provides comprehensive debugging logs.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - CI/CD Pipeline and Automated Testing (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Automated testing and CI/CD pipeline that runs on every push to catch issues early and maintain code quality

**Independent Test**: Push code to a branch and verify GitHub Actions workflow runs, executes all checks (type-check, build, tests), and reports results

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P0): Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P1): Can start after Foundational - Technically independent but logically builds on US1
  - User Story 3 (P1): Can start after Foundational - Technically independent but logically builds on US1
  - User Story 4 (P1): Can start after US1 completes - Requires extension to exist for testing
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P0)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but validates US1's build system
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent but validates US1's logging
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Depends on US1 completion - Requires extension components for CI/CD testing

**Note**: While US2 and US3 are technically independent, User Story 4 requires US1 to be complete (needs extension to test). For logical incremental delivery, complete them in order: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4.

### Within Each User Story

- **User Story 1**: All source file creation tasks (T010-T018) can run in parallel. Build and verification tasks (T019-T026) must run sequentially.
- **User Story 2**: Package.json verification (T027-T029) can be done together. Test workflow tasks (T030-T042) must run sequentially.
- **User Story 3**: Log verification tasks can be done in any order, but each requires the extension to be loaded first.
- **User Story 4**: Icon generation script (T057-T065), Vitest setup (T066-T075), Playwright setup (T076-T088), and CI workflow (T089-T106) can largely run in parallel, but each section must complete sequentially within itself. Final testing (T102-T106) requires all previous tasks to be complete.

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup phase**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Foundational phase**: T007, T008 can run in parallel (different files)
- **User Story 1**: T010-T018 can ALL run in parallel (9 files, no dependencies)
- **User Story 4**: T057 (scripts dir), T066 (tests/smoke dir), T076 (tests/e2e dir), T089 (.github dir) can run in parallel. T069+T071 (smoke test files) can run in parallel. Within each subsection, some tasks are independent.
- **Polish phase**: T107, T108, T109-T111 (documentation updates) can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all source file creation tasks for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create public/manifest.json with Manifest V3 configuration"
Task: "Create public/icons/icon-16.png placeholder icon"
Task: "Create public/icons/icon-48.png placeholder icon"
Task: "Create public/icons/icon-128.png placeholder icon"
Task: "Create src/service-worker.ts with initialization and console log"
Task: "Create src/content-script.ts with Twitter/X domain check and console log"
Task: "Create src/popup/popup.html with basic HTML structure"
Task: "Create src/popup/popup.css with minimal styling"
Task: "Create src/popup/popup.ts with popup initialization and console log"

# Then run build and verification sequentially:
Task: "Run npm run build to compile extension to dist/"
Task: "Verify build output exists in dist/"
# ... continue with verification tasks
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**:
   - Load extension in chrome://extensions
   - Verify no errors
   - Verify all components log initialization
   - Verify icon and popup appear
   - Verify content script runs on Twitter/X
5. If validation passes: **MVP is complete!** Extension can be loaded and used for development.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP DEPLOYED** (loadable extension)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enhanced development workflow
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Full debugging capability
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Automated CI/CD and quality gates
6. Complete Polish phase ‚Üí Production-ready initial setup

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (P0 - highest priority)
   - Developer B: Can help with US1 parallel tasks or prepare for US2
   - Developer C: Documentation and polish tasks
3. After US1 completes:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Build and Reload)
   - Developer B: User Story 3 (View Logs)
   - Developer C: User Story 4 (CI/CD Pipeline)
4. Stories integrate seamlessly (no conflicts - different aspects of same extension)

**Note**: For solo developer or small team, complete stories sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4) for logical incremental progress.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- No tests required for initial setup (per spec and constitution)
- Commit after completing each user story phase
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Build times should be <10 seconds (Vite performance goal)
- Total setup time from clone to loaded extension should be <5 minutes (per quickstart.md)

---

## Success Criteria Validation

After completing all tasks, verify these success criteria from spec.md:

- [ ] **SC-001**: Developer can load extension in Chrome in under 1 minute (verify with quickstart.md)
- [ ] **SC-002**: Extension appears in chrome://extensions with no errors or warnings
- [ ] **SC-003**: Code change ‚Üí rebuild ‚Üí see change in under 30 seconds (test with watch mode)
- [ ] **SC-004**: All components (service worker, content script, popup) initialize and log successfully
- [ ] **SC-005**: Extension stable when navigating between Twitter/X pages (no crashes/errors)
- [ ] **SC-006**: Developer can view logs from all components using Chrome DevTools
- [ ] **SC-007**: Build command completes in under 10 seconds for initial compilation
- [ ] **SC-008**: Extension structure follows constitutional layout (src/types/, src/extractors/, etc.)
- [ ] **SC-009**: GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully and completes all checks in under 5 minutes
- [ ] **SC-010**: All smoke tests pass (manifest validation, TypeScript compilation, build succeeds, extension loads in Playwright)
- [ ] **SC-011**: Extension icons (16x16, 48x48, 128x128) automatically generated from source thumbnail display correctly
- [ ] **SC-012**: CI workflow badge shows "passing" status on repository README

**All 12 success criteria must pass before considering this feature complete.**
