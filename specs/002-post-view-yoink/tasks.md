# Tasks: Post View Yoink

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-post-view-yoink/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (complete), spec.md (complete), research.md (complete), data-model.md (complete)

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in spec - smoke tests will be added for extraction validation only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Chrome Extension (single project)**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths follow structure defined in plan.md (src/types/, src/extractors/, src/ui/, tests/smoke/)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: TypeScript type definitions and constants used across all features

- [ ] T001 [P] Define TypeScript interfaces in src/types/tweet-data.ts (TweetData, AuthorData, MetricsData, MediaData, LinkCardData, TweetTypeFlags, ExtractionMetadata)
- [ ] T002 [P] Define extraction types in src/types/tweet-data.ts (ExtractionResult, ExtractionError, SelectorConfig, SelectorStrategy, ButtonState, ButtonStatus enum)
- [ ] T003 [P] Create SVG icon definitions in src/ui/icons.ts (yoinkIcon with "capture frame" design per research.md)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core selector infrastructure and utilities that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T004 Implement SelectorFallbackChain class in src/extractors/selectors.ts (generic fallback handler with primary/secondary/tertiary tiers)
- [ ] T005 [P] Define tweet selector configurations in src/extractors/selectors.ts (data-testid, aria-label, structural patterns per research.md)
- [ ] T006 [P] Implement confidence score calculation in src/extractors/selectors.ts (weighted algorithm from data-model.md)
- [ ] T007 [P] Create extraction utilities in src/extractors/selectors.ts (null coercion, error handling, logging helpers)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Button Injection & Positioning (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP INFRASTRUCTURE

**Goal**: Inject Yoink button as first item in tweet action bars, detect "More" button location, handle dynamic tweet loading

**Independent Test**: Navigate to x.com timeline, verify buttons appear within 500ms on all tweets in leftmost position, scroll to test stability

### Implementation for User Story 2

**Checkpoint**: Console output should include media[], linkCard{}, tweetType{}, parent{} with proper null handling

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Selector Resilience (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Implement fallback selectors for defensive extraction, calculate confidence scores, log selector failures

**Independent Test**: Manually break primary selectors in fixture HTML, verify extraction falls back and logs warnings with degraded confidence

**Dependencies**: US1 and US3 must be complete (all extractors must exist before adding fallbacks)

- [ ] T047 [US4] Add selector failure logging in src/extractors/selectors.ts (log failed selector paths with context)
- [ ] T048 [US4] Populate warnings array in ExtractionMetadata in tweet-extractor.ts (list all selector failures)

**Checkpoint**: Extraction should gracefully degrade when selectors fail, log warnings, adjust confidence scores

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Performance optimization, documentation, final validation

- [ ] T049 [P] Add WeakMap cleanup for button tracking in src/ui/button-injector.ts (prevent memory leaks)
- [ ] T050 [P] Add requestAnimationFrame for DOM modifications in src/ui/button-injector.ts (reduce layout thrashing per research.md)

- [ ] T054 Manual validation per quickstart.md (load extension, test on live x.com, verify all user stories)
- [ ] T055 Update CLAUDE.md if new patterns emerged (document any Chrome Extension best practices discovered)
- [ ] T056 [P] Create implementation summary in specs/002-post-view-yoink/implementation-summary.md (document deviations from plan, performance metrics, lessons learned)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies on other incomplete tasks
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- User stories have sequential dependencies (not fully independent): US2 ‚Üí US1 ‚Üí US3 ‚Üí US4
- Verify tests pass before implementing (TDD for smoke tests)
- Run `npm run type-check` after each phase
- Run `npm run test` after each phase with tests
- Commit after each completed user story phase
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story functionality
- MVP scope = US2 + US1 (button injection + basic extraction)
- Full feature = US2 + US1 + US3 + US4 (all priorities)
