# Specification Quality Checklist: Post View Yoink

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (All items validated)

**Changes Made**:
- Removed specific DOM selector syntax (data-testid, aria-label) from functional requirements
- Generalized technology-specific terms (MutationObserver, SVG, React, manifest.json) to technology-agnostic descriptions
- Updated Key Entities to avoid implementation details (renamed SelectorTier to ExtractionMethod, removed references to specific HTML attributes)
- All functional requirements now focus on WHAT needs to happen, not HOW to implement it

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - Specification is complete and ready for implementation planning
