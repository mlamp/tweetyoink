# Specification Quality Checklist: Debug Metadata Display in Overlay UI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass âœ…

All checklist items pass validation:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in user-focused language for developers as the target users. No implementation details (no mention of React, TypeScript, specific libraries). Focuses on WHAT (display debug info) and WHY (improve developer debugging experience).

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - Success criteria include specific metrics (100ms render time, 100% detection rate, 100KB support)
   - 3 user stories with clear priorities (P1-P3) and independent acceptance scenarios
   - 5 edge cases identified for malformed JSON, large blocks, missing fields, differentiation, and multiple blocks
   - Scope section clearly bounds what's in/out of scope
   - Assumptions section documents 5 key dependencies

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Core MVP (P1: View Debug Info) can be independently tested and delivers immediate value
   - Extension capabilities (P2: Expand/Collapse, P3: Production Filtering) build incrementally on core
   - All requirements trace back to user scenarios
   - Success criteria are measurable without knowledge of implementation (e.g., "render within 100ms" not "use React.memo()")

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No clarifications required - feature is well-defined within the context of existing TweetYoink overlay (Feature 004)
- Assumed standard collapsible UI patterns and JSON parsing as industry best practices
