# Specification Quality Checklist: Add Tweet and Author URLs to Data Schema

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items met

**Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written from analyst/user perspective without mentioning TypeScript, React, or specific technical implementations. References to "Extension" are acceptable as they describe the system boundary, not implementation.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All requirements are testable (can verify URL presence, format, and validity). No ambiguous language or clarification markers. Edge cases properly identified.

3. **Success Criteria**: All criteria are measurable (100% coverage metrics, one-click navigation) and technology-agnostic (focused on outcomes, not implementation).

4. **Feature Readiness**: User stories are prioritized and independently testable. Each story can be implemented standalone and delivers specific value.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`
- API contract updates mentioned in FR-008 and FR-009 will need to be reflected in planning phase
- Consider migration strategy for existing data during planning
